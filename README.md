# How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

# Lessons Learned:

While building this app, I learned about event handling like mousedown, mouseup and mouseover to manipulate the DOM. I have also learned about dynamically modifying the DOM by using Javascript. An additional knowledge I have learned from this project is boolean flags to control different state and managing their toggling behavior.
